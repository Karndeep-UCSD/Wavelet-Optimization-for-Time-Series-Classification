  <h3 align="center">Wavelet Optimization for Time Series Classification</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Robust real-time classification of electrocardiograms relies upon effective feature extraction and reduction. This work utilizes wavelet multi-resolution analysis(WMRA) in conjunction with principal component analysis(PCA) to generate high quality, low-dimesional feature vectors. These vectors are classified as one of six types of heart beats using a multiclass Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier. Application specific mother wavelets were determined via Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO).

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>
This work was conducted with the goal of defining a new approach to extract low dimensional features from time series ECG data for use in classification. Wavelet multi-resolution analysis is often utilized to extract a feature set from time-series data. Rather than selecting a predefined wavelet, a custom wavelet is found via particle swarm optimization. Once selected, wavelet features undergo dimensional reduction by principal component analysis before being used to train a one-vs-one support vector machine classifier. 
</p>
<p>
Two optimization schemes were implemented, record based and beat based, resulting in two different optimized wavelets. Both wavelets were evaluated with 10-fold cross validation, using a train-test split of 20/80 selected at random, as well as a patient specific scheme where only initial data, 300 beats or 60 beats, was used for training. The wavelet optimized from the record based scheme achieved <b> 98.79%, 97.54%, and 94.58% classification accuracy,</b> respectively on the three evaluation scenarios. The wavelet optimized from the beat based scheme achieved <b>98.46%. 97.80%, and 94.05%,</b> respectively on the three evaluation scenarios.

The left flow chart summaries the ECG classification framework propsed by Liu et al. that this work utilizes. 
The right chart demonstrates the implimented optimization scheme. Particle swarm optimization was used to minimize the classification error of the SVM. A global minimum was achieved by tuning the parameters of the wavelet used in the feature transformation.
